# Individual Shrub detection and shrub crown delineation using point cloud and CHM based algorithms.

* This sub-directory contains necessary code and materials for automated individual shrub detection using functions from the `lidR` and `ForestTools` R packages. 
* The code developed for this aspect of the project is an exploratory approach and thus is only applied to a subset of the study site. 
* Please refer to the manuscript for details about the project [URL FOR MANUSCRIPT]
