## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Workflow
1. Import files: dense point cloud, shrub field data, and
2. Extract 1 shrub based on corners
3. Loop through all shrubs


## library packages 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lidR)
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
```

# 1. Import and describe files
currently just importing from my desktop but we could be fancy and do through git directly

Set working directory for REM 475 Group project onedrive

### Dense point cloud
exorted from agisoft using high quality and mild point filtering
```{r}


```

### Field data
Shrub ID, field size measurements, and corner numbers
```{r}
shrub_field <- read.csv("shrub_field_data.csv", header=TRUE)
head(shrub_field)
```

## corners
RTK GPS points for the 4 corners surrounding each shrub
```{r}
corner <- read.csv("Input data - Imagery and GCPs/Shrub_corners/shrub_kill_corner_markers.csv", header=TRUE,
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
















## start off with something straightforward
Get average Z value for each shrub - I think you can do this without creating a spatial data frame

convert shrub field data from wide to long format - corner numbers
```{r}
head(shrub_field)
shrub_long = shrub_field %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('corner1', 'corner2', 'corner3', 'corner4'),
               values_to = 'Name')
head(shrub_long)
```

merge corner and long format field data 
```{r}
#we will be joining by the Name column ( # of corner), but make same data type 
shrub_long$Name = as.character(shrub_long$Name)
corner$Name = as.character(corner$Name)

shrub_corner_merge = 
  full_join(shrub_long, corner, by="Name")
```

get average Z value for each shrub 
```{r}
#Z is Ellipsoidal.height
ground_elev = 
  shrub_corner_merge %>% 
  group_by(Shrub_ID) %>%
  summarize(mean_z = mean(Ellipsoidal.height),
            sd_z = sd(Ellipsoidal.height))
ground_elev
```

add the mean z on the original field data 
```{r}
shrub_field = 
  left_join(shrub_field, ground_elev, by="Shrub_ID")

```






## I think the next step is to create polygons between corners associated with each shrub 


from the merged file of field data + corner points, cut out each shrub (using unique shrub ID)
```{r}
head(shrub_corner_merge)
unique_shrubIDs = (shrub_corner_merge$Shrub_ID) #list of the all the shrubs by their ID 
#there is a weird NA?? those are points which are not assigned to a specific shrub. Deal with this later 


#try to subsample within larger files to one which only meet condition of each ID
#make this work for one shrub first before we loop it
one_shrub_corner = shrub_corner_merge%>% filter(Shrub_ID=="ARTRW_1")

one_shrub_corner


#try to make this a loop

for (name in unique_shrubIDs){
  one_shrub_corner = shrub_corner_merge%>% filter(Shrub_ID==name)
}
  

```


create shapefile for each of these to connect the dots 
this is a boundary box for each shrub
See below where I did this for all corners for the whole study, this is same idea, but with only 4 points per shrub 

```{r}
#convert corners for EACH shrub to a spatial data frame (shapefile)

#start out with our one shrub example
one_shrub_corner

#identify column numbers for lat and long
which(colnames(one_shrub_corner)=="Longitude") #25
which(colnames(one_shrub_corner)=="Latitude") #26

#describe the CRS
utm11nCRS<- crs("+proj=utm +zone=11N +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs 
				 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0" )

#create spatial data frame
one_shrub_sdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(one_shrub_corner[,25:27],
                    one_shrub_corner,    #the R object to convert
                    proj4string = utm11nCRS)   # assign a CRS 
                                          
# plot spatial object
plot(one_shrub_sdf, 
     main="Map of one shrub corners")

```

We may need to export these later on? I don't know, worry about that later 














# get the 4 corners association with each shrub
## start by making corner into a shapefile
tutorial: https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/dc-csv-shapefile-r
I am not really sure if this is keeping the Z values
```{r}
head(corner)

#get column names 
names(corner)

#identify the x, y and z columns 
# x = corner$Longitude
# y = corner$Latitude
# z = corner$Ellipsoidal.height


#describe the CRS
utm11nCRS<- crs("+proj=utm +zone=11N +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs 
				 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0" )


#create spatial data frame
corner_sdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(corner[,6:7],
                    corner,    #the R object to convert
                    proj4string = utm11nCRS)   # assign a CRS 
                                          
# double check the CRS
crs(corner_sdf)



# plot spatial object
plot(corner_sdf, 
     main="Map of Plot Locations")


```



# Segmenting .las point cloud to shapefile (.shp) (or SpatialPolygon (sp))
### NOTE: the polygon that defines the 4 corners and outlines the shrub does not have to be in a shapefile (.shp) format, the 'clip_roi' function that is used to segment (clip) the point cloud to the polygon only takes in the vector as a SpatialPolygon (sp) so no matter what format the vector is in, the script will convert it to sp class 

## Loading data and converting to required data class format:

### Load necessary libraries 
```{r}
require(sp)
require(sf)
require(raster)
require(rLiDAR)
require(lidR)
require(rgdal)
require(terra)

```

### Import point cloud as LAS catalog. I think it is better to use a 'LAS catalog' format as it is easier to clip multifeature polygon (vector file containing a lot of polygons). 

```{r}
las <- readLAScatalog("~/[FilePath]/[PointCloud_FileName].las")

```

### Set CRS for LAScatalog (Point Cloud data)
```{r}
st_crs(las) <- 6340 #set to NAD83 Z11 (same as Shapefile or other Vector format used)

```

### Importing shapefile for clipping the point cloud as a 'simple feature' (sf) class. IGNORE if the vector file to be used for segmentation is alread in 'SpatialPolygon' (sp) class, SKIP to line [ ]
``` {r}
sf <- st_read(dsn = "~/[FilePath]/[Shapefile_FileName].shp", layer = "[Shapefile_FileName]")

```

### The imported 'simple feature (sf)' class (shapefile) has XYZ dimension, the 'clip_roi' function to be used to segment the point cloud can only take in SpatialPolygon data that is in XY dimensions.
### Remove Z dimension of the sf class data (imported shapefile)
```{r}
sf_rmZ <- st_zm(sf) #'sf_zm' function removes the Z dimension to create an sf class with only XY dimensions 

```
### Convert the 2 dimension sf class to sp class (simple feature to spatial polygon)
```{r}
SpP <- as(st_geometry(sf_rmZ), "Spatial")

```

## Clipping vector data (sp class) to point cloud data (LAS catalog class)

### Set desitnation file path and file naming rule for the individual point clouds outputs (for each polygon). 
### NOTES: 
### -  The file naming rule should be based on an ID feature that defines each polygon of the vector dataset ('SpP' dataset).The ID feature should be set while creating the shapefile or whatever the vector file we create for the 4 corners. 
### - It is basically something that defines each polygon we create and thus defines each plant, can be as simple as a column called 'ObjectID' or 'ID' and numbering from 1 to however many polygons we have in total (I think we have around 100?) s

```{r}
opt_output_files(las) <- "~/[FilePath]/[Segmented_PointCloud_Name]_{ID}" #this sets up the directory where the R will save the segmented point clouds.

#For example if '[Segmented_PointCloud_Name]_{ID}' is set as 'Shrub_{ID}' and {ID} is the name of the feature in the vector file used that uniquely defines each polygon (e.g. ID = 01), then the output point cloud will be named as 'shrub_01.las'

```

### Segmenting the point cloud (.las file) to the 4-corner vector files (sp format)

```{r}
clipped_las <- clip_roi(las,SpP) 

#'clip_roi' is the new function that replaced 'lasclip'. If you try to use 'lasclip' function, it will return a message that the fucntion is now defunct and suggests you to use 'clip_roi' function. 
```
